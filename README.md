 - Option 1:
I am looking to extract live stock market data from Yahoo Finance or a similar source. I want to create a live working website that shows different stock forecast prices. I will create my own models and compare it with FBprophet. I will use either Streamlit or Flask to create my app.

- Option 2: If I have issues extracting the data, I can use this dataset from Kaggle.
